# DataBindingAdapters
Utils to implement databinding in ListViews and RecyclerViews

### Integration


### [Demo](https://github.com/navasmdc/DemoApp)

This library will be your life easier when you try to implement an adapater through _Databinding_. You just to bind your list and which layout you want to inflate,  to one of the `ListView`or `RecyclerView` that the library provides and the library will do the work for you.

```xml
<com.gc.databinidingadapters.DataBindingRecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/lvProducts"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            app:data="@{viewModel.products}"
            app:itemLayout="@layout/product_item"
            app:onItemClickListener="@{viewModel.itemClickListener}"/>

```
>If you want to have your list always updated, donÂ´t worry, the library provides an `ObservableList` which works together with the adapters helping for the listviews are updated. You just to _add_, _remove_ or _update_ an item and the list view will be refreshed.

 
>Any way altough you don't want to use a list from the library because you have a custom view whick works with a adapter, you are able to use an adapter from the library, for that, you just to have to provide it two parameters:

```kotlin

```
